# PACMAN
<text>FaCKman - Similar to original PACMAN game. Runs in Command Line Interface, written 100% in C language</text>
<br />
<text>Recommended terminal font face: <strong>Lucida Console</strong></text>
### Please run the .exe as administrator to automatically set up font size & family as changing the console font typically requires administrator privileges. 
### Unfortunately, there is no straightforward way to bypass this requirement programmatically due to security restrictions in Windows.
